# MLOps Implementation with DVC and Airflow: A Hands-on Guide

## Introduction
Weather prediction serves as an excellent example for implementing MLOps practices. This project demonstrates how to build a production-ready machine learning pipeline using Data Version Control (DVC) and Apache Airflow, focusing on real-time weather data collection and prediction.

## Project Overview
Our MLOps pipeline implements:
- Data collection from OpenWeatherMap API
- Data versioning with DVC
- Automated workflows with Airflow
- Model training and versioning
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes deployment

## Key Learnings
1. Data Version Control
   - Importance of tracking data changes
   - Managing different data versions
   - Integration with CI/CD

2. Workflow Automation
   - Task scheduling and dependencies
   - Error handling and retries
   - Pipeline monitoring

3. MLOps Best Practices
   - Containerization
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Automated testing

## Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates how DVC and Airflow create a robust MLOps pipeline. Key benefits include:
- Automated data collection and preprocessing
- Version control for both data and models
- Scalable deployment with Kubernetes
- Continuous integration and deployment
